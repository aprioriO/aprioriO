  <h1>👩🏼‍💻 About Me</h1>
</div>

Hello, I am Olena, and I have a unique combination of technical experience and creativity to offer the world of technology.
I have earned a background in project management, business analysis, and no-code development and have been creating ideas into life and bridging the gap between business needs and technical solutions for several years.

Then I wanted more and became a developer.
Now, with skills in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and other technologies, I build full-stack applications that are functional and user-oriented.
My approach is a mix of deep business process understanding with precision from a developer's point of view, hence allowing me to create solutions that make an impact.

I’m passionate about clean code, solving problems, and constantly learning. Whether it’s collaborating on a new product or improving existing systems, I’m ready to bring value, creativity, and dedication to your team. Let’s build something amazing together!
